# Serialised Comic Website – Full-Stack Application

## Overview

This project is a full-stack website developed to host and manage a serialised comic. The platform provides a complete reader experience alongside a comprehensive admin interface for content management. The frontend is built with **React.js**, while the backend uses **Express.js** and a **MySQL** database to store and serve all site data. The website also features a custom font created using **FontForge** to support the comic’s visual identity.
